# System-Verilog-Verification-for-ALU-with-Functional-coverage
This project implements a simple Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) supporting eight fundamental operations, including arithmetic and logical functions. The design was verified using a SystemVerilog testbench architecture, leveraging constrained-random stimulus, and a functional coverage model to ensure thorough validation. The verification environment tracks operation types, operand ranges, and corner cases, providing measurable confidence in correctness and robustness. This repository demonstrates both the ALU design and its complete verification flow, serving as a compact example of functional verification methodology in SystemVerilog.
