# System-Verilog-Verification-for-ALU-with-Functional-coverage
This project implements a simple Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) supporting eight fundamental operations, including arithmetic and logical functions. The design was verified using a SystemVerilog testbench architecture, leveraging constrained-random stimulus, and a functional coverage model to ensure thorough validation.
